# [Feed-Me-Now](https://feed-me-now-1.herokuapp.com/)

## General Info
This project idea stems from my indecisive nature when choosing a restaurant to eat. Yelp is useful in providing many choices, but there is too many to choose from! With that said, I've decided to make this web application to choose one random restaurant in your surrounding area and also map out the directions to the restaurant from your location. Can't decide or don't know how to get there? Feed-Me-Now got you covered.. :D
